# odin-recipes
Hello! This is my first project from The Odin Project where I will create a basic recipe website using the fundamentals of HTML
that I have been taught so far, which are creating the basic HTML boilerplate, embedding images and links, using elements and tags to 
create a functional title, heading and body, making ordered and unordered lists, and creating a cohesive and simple website.
